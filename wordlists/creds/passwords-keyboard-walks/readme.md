"Keyboard walks" are referring to passwords based on adjacent or repetitive keys on the keyboard to make them easier to remember.. for example `qwertyuiop[]` or `asdfgh` or `1111111111111111111111`

Sometimes, keyboard walking patterns are a little more well thought-out in order to meet password-complexity requirements, some examples of this could be:

    1qaz@WSX3edc$RFV (one-down, shift two-down, three-down, shift four-down)
    ZAQ!2wsxXSW@1qaz (shift one-up, two-down, shift two-up, one-down)
    1234qwer$#@!REWQ (one-right, q-right, shift one-left, shift q-left)
    1q2w#E$R (half one-down, half two-down, shift half three-down, shift half four-down)


Lots of people set passwords in this manner because, well, they're dumb..
